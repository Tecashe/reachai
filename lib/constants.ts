Would you be interested in learning how they did it?

I've reached out a few times about {{topic}} but haven't heard back.

I don't want to be a pest, so I'll assume this isn't a priority for {{company}} right now.

If that changes, feel free to reach out. Otherwise, I'll close your file.

Best of luck with {{recent_initiative}}!

I realize my previous email about {{original_topic}} might not have resonated.

Let me try a different angle: What if you could {{alternative_benefit}} without {{common_objection}}?

That's exactly what we did for {{case_study_company}}. Worth a quick chat?
